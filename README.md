# Ocean-Wave-Height-Estimation
Applied financial time-series volatility models (GARCH family) to ocean wave radar data to estimate significant wave height. Bridged concepts from quantitative finance and ocean engineering to optimize accuracy and scalability, achieving a 95% reduction in processing time while maintaining strong validation against buoy measurements.
